<h2 align="center">Time And Distance </h2>
1. Speed, Time and Distance : Speed = Distance/Time ,Time = Distance/Speed , Distance= (Speed x Time).
<br></br>
2. km/hr to m/sec conversion : x km/hr = x * (5/18) m/sec.
<br></br>
3. m/sec to km/hr conversion : x m/sec = x * (18/5) km/hr.
<br></br>
4. If the ratio of the speeds of A and B is a : b.
<br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then the ratio of the
&nbsp;the times taken by then to cover the same distance is 1:1 or b : a.
<br></br>
5. Suppose a man covers a certain distance at x km/hr and an equal distance at y km/hr.
<br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the average speed during the whole journey is 2xy/(x+y) km/hr.
