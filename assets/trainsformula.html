<h3 align="center">Trains Formula</h3>
<b>1.</b> km/hr to m/s conversion:
<br></br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a km/hr = (a*(5/18)) m/s.
<br></br>
<b>2.</b> m/s to km/hr conversion:
<br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a m/s = (a*(18/5)) km/hr.
<h4> Formulas for finding Speed, Time and Distance</h4>
<b>3.</b> Time taken by a train of length l metres<br></br> to pass a pole or standing man or a signal post
is equal<br></br> to the time taken by the train to cover l metres.<br></br>
<b>4.</b> Time taken by a train of length l metres<br></br> to pass a stationery object of length b metres is
the<br></br> time taken by the train to cover (l + b) metres.<br></br>
<b>5.</b> Suppose two trains or two objects bodies are<br></br> moving in the same direction at u m/s
and v m/s,<br></br> where u > v, then their relative speed is = (u - v) m/s.<br></br>
<b>6.</b> Suppose two trains or two objects bodies are <br></br>moving in opposite directions at u m/s
and v m/s,<br></br> then their relative speed is = (u + v) m/s.<br></br>
<b>7.</b> If two trains of length a metres and b metres<br></br> are moving in opposite directions at u m/s
and v m/s,then:<br></br>
The time taken by the trains to cross each other =(a + b) /(u + v)sec.<br></br>
<b>8.</b> If two trains of length a metres and b metres are<br></br> moving in the same direction at u m/s
and v m/s, then:<br></br>
The time taken by the faster train to <br></br>cross the slower train =(a + b) /(u - v)sec.<br></br>
<b>9.</b> If two trains (or bodies) start at the same time<br></br> from points A and B towards each other
and<br></br> after crossing they take a and b sec <br></br>in reaching B and A respectively, then:<br></br>
(A's speed) : (B's speed) = (b : a)
