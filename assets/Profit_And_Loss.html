<h2 align="center">Profit and Loss</h2>
<b>IMPORTANT FACTS</b>
<br></br>
Cost Price : The price, at which an article is purchased, is called its cost price, abbreviated as C.P.
<br></br>
Selling Price : The price, at which an article is sold, is called its selling prices, abbreviated as S.P.
<br></br>
Profit or Gain : If S.P. is greater than C.P., the seller is said to have a profit or gain.
<br></br>
Loss : If S.P. is less than C.P., the seller is said to have incurred a loss.
<br></br>
<b>IMPORTANT FORMULAE</b>
<br></br>
1. Gain = (S.P.) - (C.P.)
<br></br>
2. Loss = (C.P.) - (S.P.)
<br></br>
3. Loss or gain is always reckoned on C.P.
<br></br>
4. Gain Percentage: (Gain per)
<br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gain per = (Gain x 100)/C.P.
<br></br>
5. Loss Percentage: (Loss per)
<br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loss per = (Loss x 100)/C.P.
<br></br>
6. Selling Price: (S.P.)
<br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SP = ((100 + Gainper)/100) * C.P.
<br></br>
7. Selling Price: (S.P.)
<br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SP = ((100 - Lossper)/100) * C.P.
<br></br>
8. Cost Price: (C.P.)
<br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.P. =(100 / (100 + Gainper)) * S.P.
<br></br>
9. Cost Price: (C.P.)
<br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.P. = (100 / (100-Lossper)) * S.P.
<br></br>
10. If an article is sold at a gain of say 35per, then S.P.= 135per of C.P.
<br></br>
11. If an article is sold at a loss of say, 35per then S.P. = 65per of C.P.
<br></br>
12. When a person sells two similar items, one at a gain of say xper, and the other at a loss
<br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of xper, then the seller always incurs a loss given by:
<br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loss per = ((Common Loss and Gain per )/10) * 2= (x / 10) * 2.
<br></br>
13. If a trader professes to sell his goods at cost price,but uses false weights, then
<br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gain per = ((Error/((True Value) - (Error))* 100)per.
