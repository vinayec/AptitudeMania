<h3 align="center">Alligation or Mixture Important Formulas</h3>
<h4>1. Alligation:</h4><br></br>
It is the rule that enables us to find the ratio in which two or more ingredients at the<br></br>
given price must be mixed to produce a mixture of desired price.<br></br>
<h4>2. Mean Price:</h4>
The cost of a unit quantity of the mixture is called the mean price.<br></br>
<h4>3. Rule of Alligation:</h4>
If two ingredients are mixed, then<br></br>
(Quantity of cheaper/Quantity of dearer) = (C.P. of dearer - Mean Price)/(Mean price - C.P. of cheaper)<br></br>
We present as under:<br></br>
C.P. of a unit quantity of cheaper (c) <br></br>
C.P. of a unit quantity of dearer  (d) <br></br>
Mean Price (m)<br></br>
(Cheaper quantity) : (Dearer quantity) = (d - m) : (m - c)<br></br>
<b>4.</b> Suppose a container contains x of liquid from which y units are taken out and replaced
by water.<br></br>
After n operations, the quantity of pure liquid = (x(1-(y/x))n)<br></br>
